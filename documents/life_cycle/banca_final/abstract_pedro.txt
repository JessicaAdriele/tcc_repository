Technology is a very practical tool which may be used to meet the needs currently faced by companies. In order to facilitate the operation and managements of these companies, new software is developed as a solution to address these needs. Each developed functionality makes the software larger and more complex, so it is necessary to ensure that their functions are fully operational, because a stoppage or a crash can result in enormous financial and humanistic damages. Due of this increasing complexity of software, maintenance and expansion have become both complicated and costly. In this scenario, modularizing the application by dividing its functions and tasks into smaller components has become of paramount importance and, through the support offered by the OSGi technology, and a large number of reusable features, decoupling, cohesion and management of modules was obtained without having compromised system operations. In addition to what was documented, beyond the understanding of the functionality of a modularized software and the creation of an application that uses these concepts and theories, the development of this research was demonstrated.
